- Paste as many URL's as you want!
- Download all mp3 files in best quality (160kbps) at once!
- All downloaded files are stored in `Downloads` directory in the same place where the binary file is.

## Important notes
- After you click download you have to **wait**! (depending on how much are you downloading) It may take a few minutes. The program may look **jammed**, but it is actually downloading files!

## Further goals:
- Add support for video files and other formats
- Make more usable gui with options
